# Week 6 Challenge - Weather Application

Built a weather application using the OpenWeatherMap API.

- You can search for any city you want
- You can use the quick links to pick a recent city you viewed
- The background changes depending on the weather in the area

The time that displays is your current time, but the temperature, wind and humidity are from the city you searched for.
